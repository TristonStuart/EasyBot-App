## Outline / Guidlines when contributing :
Ok so this is a node.js app, using chrome, it will launch chrome to 127.0.0.1:800 after it starts a webserver.<br>
Chrome will need to be used unless someone can add multi-browser support.<br>
The app should store data in raw UTF-8 Files, should store a backup incase accidental deletion of file.<br>
Using the data / bot settings created the user will be converted into a proper javascript file, that can then be executed.<br>
I will try to figure out a way to compile this javascript file into an exe, although the user may need to install node.js which we dont want.
